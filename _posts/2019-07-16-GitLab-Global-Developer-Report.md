Earlier this year, I participated in the 2019 Global Developer Report. Yesterday, it has been completed and released.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have liftoff! üöÄThe 2019 Global Developer Report: DevSecOps has launched. Thanks to your input, we&#39;ve learned a ton about how developers, security, and operations are working together, and where the big roadblocks are. Let us know what you think! <a href="https://t.co/TOAu6CXrTz">https://t.co/TOAu6CXrTz</a> <a href="https://t.co/wLdhSuklTq">pic.twitter.com/wLdhSuklTq</a></p>&mdash; GitLab (@gitlab) <a href="https://twitter.com/gitlab/status/1150777702632370177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">15.

You can grab your copy [at GitLab's website](https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/2019/), however, you need to provide your name and company e-mail. I highly recommend anyone in IT to have a look at it.

This years report has the topic **DevSecOps**, so it focusses on how teams utilize DevOps-practices while also looking at how this affects security.

### Underrated aspect of the report

GitLab is a company, where all employees work remotely distributed across the üåç.
Their reports always contain insight on if and how remote work is done and how it affects the covered topics.

As most software-companys struggle to grow their crews, I think remote work is the answer as there is great professional potential in rural areas.
The report shows that potential problems of remote teams are no show-stoppers, although it requires discipline which in turn can improve overall performance/quality.

#### GitLab Handbook

If you are interested in how a globally distributed software-team works, I highly recommend to have a look at [GitLabs "Handbook" üìô](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).
It is kind of a guide for GitLabs employees on how to work and collaborate efficiently while working remotely.
The handbook also give you a good idea of GitLabs corporate culture and much more.

### Gimme more!

There are other surveys and reports I always look at as they are released.
My favorites (apart from the GitLab Developer Report) are:

1. [The StackOverflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019)
2. [The "Currents" by Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/currents/) (although the last one appeared almost a year ago)
